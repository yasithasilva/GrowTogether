    <h1>What we believe</h1>

    <p> Our vision is for a just and sustainable world. We are pursuing on achieving the goal <b>‘No Poverty’</b> 
        to build a world where people and the environment are at the heart of just economies. A world free of 
        gender-based violence and discrimination for women and girls. When the climate crisis is contained and
        inclusive and accountable governance structures are in place, those in positions of power can be held accountable.
