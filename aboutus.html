    <h1>What we believe</h1>

    <p> Our vision is for a just and sustainable world. We are pursuing on achieving the goal <b>‘No Poverty’</b> 
        to build a world where people and the environment are at the heart of just economies. A world free of 
        gender-based violence and discrimination for women and girls. When the climate crisis is contained and
        inclusive and accountable governance structures are in place, those in positions of power can be held accountable.</p>

    <h1>More about us and what we do</h1>

    <p> We started our organization in 2017 based on the 1st SDG goal of the 17 SDG goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015.
        We are currently working on achieving the goal by donating and volunteering and we’re focusing not only one area, 
        we’re planning on targeting countries worldwide. We work with thousands of partners and allies across 70 countries 
        to help communities develop better lives for themselves, build resilience, and protect lives and livelihoods even 
        in times of catastrophe. We combat inequities that keep people trapped in poverty and injustice - and work for meaningful, 
        long-term change - because we seek long-term answers.</p>
