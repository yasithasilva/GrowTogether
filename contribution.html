        <h2 class="cont-headi">Why is it important to reduce poverty?</h2>
        <p class="para001">
          This is an important subject to consider, and one that is frequently overlooked. 
          Poverty, without a doubt, takes a severe toll on those who are caught up in it.
           One of the most constant findings in epidemiology is that lower socioeconomic position, 
           particularly destitution, has a detrimental impact on an individual's health. 
           Poverty is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, 
           infant mortality, mental illness, undernutrition, lead poisoning, asthma, and dental issues, among other things.</p>
           
          <p class="para001"> So in this section we hope to give you an understanding of the measures taken for poverty reduction in three main sections.</p>
