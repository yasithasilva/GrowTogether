          <p>China has aided in the reduction of world poverty by  <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2018/05/31.pdf" target="_blank"> more than 70%.</a>
             Between 1981 and 2013, China raised a total of 850 million people out of poverty.
              In China, the fraction of individuals living on less than $1.90 has decreased from 88 percent to less than 2% in 32 years.</p>

              <h2>Brazil.</h2>

                The Continuous Cash Benefit is a type of income transfer that is specifically designed for the elderly and disabled.</p>

                <h2>Canada.</h2>
                <p>In 2017, Canada's poverty-reduction programs aided over 2 million people.
