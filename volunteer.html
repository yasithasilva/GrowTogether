        To reduce poverty, we need growth. <br> And to advance growth we need adequate And reliable energy.
    </H1>
    <p>
        Maybe you’ve been feeling the urge to do something – but you aren’t sure what. Maybe you feel overwhelmed. Maybe 
        you wish that you could have a say in the policies and do something that impacts millions of people around the globe.
          Well, now you can.
 
        People all over the world engage in volunteerism for a great variety of reasons. Somehow, in the end, volunteerism makes
         a specific contribution by generating well-being for people and their communities.

            With every hour of their time, Grow Together volunteers multiply their impact through the enormous power of

            raise billions of dollars for the world’s most vulnerable children.Volunteers are well-placed to support poverty 
            reduction strategies and create pathways to the economic empowerment of women and youth.

            Our volunteer advocates come from all walks of life but share a desire to stand up for issues they care about, 
            be heard, and make an impact. At  Grow Together, we teach you the nuts and bolts of how to do that. We teach you 
            how to become an advocate. Volunteer with Grow Together and make a real difference in ending poverty!
